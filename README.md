## Project Description
The purpose of our system is to provide a platform for individuals to monitor and improve their mental health. Our application aims to tackle the growing problem of depression, which is a common mental illness affecting many people today. The main function of our system is to provide an easy and accessible way for individuals to diagnose their level of depression, using a machine learning model that outputs a corresponding depression score based on a picture of a person's face. As long as the individual is logged in, our platform also provides a section for users to communicate and discuss mental health concerns with others, as well as an educational section that provides knowledge about mental health and wellness. Additionally, our system takes privacy into consideration, ensuring that user data is protected. The app will have a dashboard for recording and visualizing data, making it easy for individuals to track their progress over time. With all these features combined, our system aims to provide a comprehensive solution to help individuals improve and maintain their mental health.
